# Creating Amazon EC2 Instances

- **Amazon EC2 Instances** are virtual servers that run on the AWS cloud platform.
	- They allow you to choose the CPU, memory, storage, and networking resources that suit your applications.
	- You can also select different purchasing options and root volume types for your instances.
	- Amazon EC2 Instances are scalable, secure, and easy to manage with AWS tools.

- AWS provides multiple ways to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. 
	- AWS Management Console
	- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
